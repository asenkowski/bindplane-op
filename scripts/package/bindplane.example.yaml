# TLS configuration for TLS and Mutual TLS.
#
# Enable client server TLS:
#   set "tlsCert" and "tlsKey" on the server
#   set "tlsCa" on the client or import the certificate authority into the operating systems certificate store.
#   all agent's should trust the certificate authority (see your agents documentation).
#
# Enable client server mutual TLS:
#  set "tlsCert", "tlsKey", "tlsCa" on the server and all clients.
#  all agent's should be configured for mutual TLS (see your agents documentation).

#
# The path to the x509 PEM encoded certificate file.
