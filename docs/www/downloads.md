The recommended way to install BindPlane OP is using the install commands found on the [Installation](doc:installation) page. Alternatively, these are direct downloads to server and client packages.

## Direct Download Links

Direct download links can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/observIQ/bindplane-op/releases) page of the BindPlane OP repo.

> ðŸ“˜ Client Installation
> 
> For macOS and Windows, place the BindPlane binary / exe in the user's path or execute it directly. For Debian and RHEL platforms, the installation is the same as BindPlane server, however, only the BindPlane binary is installed (User and config, log, storage directories are not created).
