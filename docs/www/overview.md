## Agents

This is the first stop to quickly view your fleet of agents. From this page you can navigate to view agents configuration, status, or error directly by clicking on the agent name. Alternatively you can see which configuration resources are deployed to these agents in the "Configuration" column. Easily narrow your view with the search bar and suggested filters.

## Configs

Here is the entry point to view all your current configurations. Its from here where you can select a configuration to edit or create a new configuration with the button on the top right.

## Components

Here is where you'll find all your reusable resources. In particular any Destinations that you have created inside configurations can be viewed, edited, and deleted on this tab.
