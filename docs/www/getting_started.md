# Welcome to BindPlane OP

This guide will walk you through installing [BindPlane OP](https://github.com/observIQ/bindplane-op) on Linux, adding an Agent, and configuring a Destination.

## Step 1: Installing and Configuring BindPlane OP

### Installation

An installation script is available to simplify installation. To see further installation options, check out our [Installation](doc:installation) page.

**BindPlane OP Open Source**

```bash
curl -fsSlL https://github.com/observiq/bindplane-op/releases/latest/download/install-linux.sh | bash -s --
```


**BindPlane OP Enterprise**

If you have an enterprise license, install with the `--enterprise` flag.

```bash
curl -fsSlL https://github.com/observiq/bindplane-op/releases/latest/download/install-linux.sh | bash -s -- --enterprise
```

### Configuration

#### Initialize Server

First step is to initialize the server. For Linux, the default command for this is:

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/bindplane init server --config /etc/bindplane/config.yaml
```


> ðŸ“˜ Get the `bindplane init` command from the installer
> 
> The **Server Initialization** section of the installer will have the exact `bindplane init` command for your system.

This does the following to parameters in the `config.yaml` located by default at `/etc/bindplane/config.yaml`.

- Set `host` to the instance's IP address, or 0.0.0.0 to bind to all IP addresses.
- Set `username` to your desired username
- Set `password` to your desired password
- Set `serverURL` to the HTTP endpoint of the server.
- Set `remoteURL` to the web socket endpoint of the server
- Add `secretKey` to a new randomly generated UUID. This is automatically generated by the `init` command.

#### Restart Server

Use the following command to restart the BindPlane server.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart bindplane
```


### Viewing BindPlane Logs

Web server access logs can be viewed with:

```bash
sudo journalctl -f --unit bindplane
```


All other BindPlane logs are written to `/var/log/bindplane/bindplane.log`. This log file is rotated and compressed by the BindPlane process.

### Using CLI

The BindPlane CLI can be used from the BindPlane Server. For an example command, run:

```bash
sudo bindplane --config /etc/bindplane/config.yaml help
```


For a detailed list of commands and a guide to installing the CLI on remote clients, see our [CLI](doc:cli) page.

## Step 2: Access BindPlane UI

The BindPlane UI can be accessed with your browser on port 3001. The URL will be `http://<IP Address>:3001` with IP Address being the IP of the BindPlane server. To log in, use the credentials you specified when running the `init` command.

In the UI, you'll find the Agents, Configs, and Components tabs. Next, you'll setup an agent.

## Step 3: Install an Agent

### Installation

Click the **Install Agents** button. Choose the operating system for the intended agent host, and copy the command generated. Run this command on your agent host system.  
BindPlane installs the observIQ Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector, to learn more checkout the [GitHub](https://github.com/observIQ/observiq-otel-collector) page.

Upon successfully installing the agent, it will appear back on the **Agents** tab with a "Connected" status.

## Step 4: Configuration

To setup a configuration for the agent, navigate to the **Configs** tab and click **New Configuration**.

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/bindplane-op-doc-images/guides/getting-started/bindplane_config_new.png" width="1000px" alt="bindplane_config_new.png">


You'll now be in the configuration wizard. First is to name your config (see naming rules below). Then choose a platform for it to run on that corresponds to your agent(s). You can optionally add a description for the config, then click **Next**.

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/bindplane-op-doc-images/guides/getting-started/bindplane_wizard_details.png" width="1000px" alt="bindplane_wizard_details.png">


> ðŸš§ Note: Rules for naming configs.
> 
> - must be 63 characters or less
> - must begin and end with an alphanumeric character ( [a-z0-9A-Z] )
> - can contain dashes ( - ), underscores ( \_ ), dots ( . ), and alphanumerics between

> ðŸ“˜ You can use existing OpenTelemetry config.yaml files.
> 
> If you already have an OpenTelemetry `config.yaml`, you can click the link to the raw configuration wizard. Add a name, choose a platform, and optionally add a description, then click _Next_. You can then either upload or copy and paste your `config.yaml` into BindPlane.
> 
> You can also import existing configs after the agent is added from the agent page.

### Add a Source

Now you can add sources to your config. For this example, we'll just be using the Host source to collect host metrics. Add the source and set the parameters.

For the Host source, there are many metrics enabled by default and optional metrics that can also be enabled.

Click **Save** when you're done with the source configuration. You can add more sources, click on existing ones to see their configuration and edit or remove them, or click **Next** to move on to adding a destination.

### Add a Destination

Last step is to add a destination. In this example, we'll use Google Cloud. Select the destination and configure the required settings.

For Google Cloud, enter a name (corresponding with the same naming rules listed above), fill in your project ID, then select the authentication method. If the VM running your BindPlane agent is already in Google Cloud, then you can leave the authentication method to auto. Otherwise, copy the contents of a credential json and paste it into the configuration wizard, or create a credentials file and place it on the host system, then fill in the file path in the configuration wizard.

When you're finished with the destination configuration, click **Save**. You can click on the destination to see the configuration and edit or remove it, or click **Save** to move on to finish the configuration.

> ðŸ“˜ Creating a credentials file for Google Cloud
> 
> A Google Cloud Service Account can used for authentication by creating a service account and key.
> 
> [Create a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts) with the following roles:
> 
> - Metrics: roles/monitoring.metricWriter
> - Logs: roles/logging.logWriter
> - Traces: roles/cloudtrace.agent
> 
> [Create a service account json key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) and place it on the system that is running the collector.

### Apply Configuration

The next page is the Details page for the config you just created. At the bottom of the page in the Agents section, click the **+** icon to add an agent. Select which agents you'd like to apply the config to, then click **Apply**. Just like that, the config is now running on the agent!
